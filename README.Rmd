[x] 1. check if composites are possible in OPAL, NOT possible
[ ] 2. make github repo, push

## create rmd for

singlechoice, multiplechoice, clozes at the end

dropdown, associate, order, match

essay (extended_text in qti)

be creative:
clozes in between text, dropdowns in between text -> implement some yaml for input

## making gaps

Simply use <<>> for a gap, example:

Some Text, and now the gap: <<extype:num, solution:10, length:3>> Some more text.

The goal of qti is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of qti like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(qti)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
